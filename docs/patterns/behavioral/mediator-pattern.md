# Mediator Pattern

- A mediator is defined as a person who makes people involved in a conflict
come to an agreement.

- This pattern is applied to encapsulate or centralize the interactions amongst a number of objects. Object orientated design may result in behavior being distributed among several classes and lead to too many connections among objects. The encapsulation keeps the objects from referring to each other directly and the objects don't hold references to each other anymore.
- Formally, the pattern is defined as encouraging loose coupling among interacting objects by encapsulating their interactions in a mediator object, thus avoiding the need for individual objects to refer to each other directly and allowing to vary object interactions independently.
- In object-oriented programming, programs often consist of many classes. Business logic and computation are distributed among these classes. However, as more classes are added to a program, especially during maintenance and/or refactoring, the problem of communication between these classes may become more complex. This makes the program harder to read and maintain. Furthermore, it can become difficult to change the program, since any change may affect code in several other classes.
- With the mediator pattern, communication between objects is encapsulated within a mediator object. Objects no longer communicate directly with each other, but instead communicate through the mediator. This reduces the dependencies between communicating objects, thereby reducing coupling.

- Examples: Rabbit MQ, Kafka

## Note

- Many to many communication, where as in Observer pattern it is One to many communication.

## Example

- Say we are asked to develop the vital monitor system, where it has to monitor different vitals like SPO2, Pulse etc. from their respective sensors and this data has to show in the watch display also need alert the care taker on timely manner.
  - constrains:
    - more Vital can be added, i,e it should auto scale.
    - Given observers (Cloud uploader, watch display, etc) can only interested in uploading/ showing necessary vitals as per user configured. i.e. subscribes to the given vital.
    - Observers can be scaled. say i future i would need to upload the data to could for analytics.

## Other examples

- `java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService` an Executor that provides methods to manage termination and methods that can produce a Future for tracking progress of one or more asynchronous tasks.
- `java.util.Timer` A facility for threads to schedule tasks for future execution in a background thread. Tasks may be scheduled for one time execution, or for repeated execution at regular intervals.

## UML class and sequence diagram

![alt](../resources/W3sDesign_Mediator_Design_Pattern_UML.jpg)

In the above UML class diagram, the Colleague1 and Colleague2 classes do not refer to (and update) each other directly. Instead, they refer to the common Mediator interface for controlling and coordinating interaction (mediate()), which makes them independent from one another with respect to how the interaction is carried out. The Mediator1 class implements the interaction between Colleague1 and Colleague2.

The UML sequence diagram shows the run-time interactions. In this example, a Mediator1 object mediates (controls and coordinates) the interaction between Colleague1 and Colleague2 objects.

Assuming that Colleague1 wants to interact with Colleague2 (to update/synchronize its state, for example), Colleague1 calls mediate(this) on the Mediator1 object, which gets the changed data from Colleague1 and performs an action2() on Colleague2.

Thereafter, Colleague2 calls mediate(this) on the Mediator1 object, which gets the changed data from Colleague2 and performs an action1() on Colleague1.
