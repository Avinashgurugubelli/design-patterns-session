# Memento pattern

- Memento pattern is used to restore state of an object to a previous state. As your application is progressing, you may want to save checkpoints in your application and restore back to those checkpoints later.
- In general, we take photo to capture the moments, and so we can rejoice the memory later by looking into the captured photos.
- Ctrl+Z (Undo) feature implementation.
