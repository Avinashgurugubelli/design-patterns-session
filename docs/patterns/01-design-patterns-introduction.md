# Design Patterns

- Why do we need patterns? The blunt answer is we don't want to
reinvent the wheel!

# Types of design patterns

Design patterns for object orientated programs are divided into three
broad categories listed below.

1. Creational
2. Structural
3. Behavioural

## 1.Creational Pattern

- Creational design patterns relate to how objects are constructed from
classes
- The creational design pattern come with powerful suggestions on how
best to encapsulate the object creation process in a program.
  1. [Builder Pattern](./creational/builder-pattern.md)
  2. Prototype Pattern
  3. Singleton Pattern
  4. Abstract Factory Patter

## 2. Structural Pattern

- Structural patterns are concerned with the composition of classes i.e. how
the classes are made up or constructed. These include:
  1. Adapter Pattern
  2. Bridge Pattern
  3. Composite Pattern
  4. Decorator Pattern
  5. Facade Pattern
  6. Flyweight Pattern
  7. Proxy Pattern

## 3. Behavioral pattern

- Behavioral design patterns dictate the interaction of classes and objects
among each other and the delegation of responsibility. These include:
  1. Interpreter Pattern
  2. Template Pattern
  3. Chain of Responsibility Pattern
  4. Command Pattern
  5. Iterator Pattern
  6. Mediator Pattern
  7. Memento Pattern
  8. Observer Pattern
  9. State Pattern
  10. [Strategy Pattern](behavioral/strategy-pattern.md)
  11. Visitor Pattern
