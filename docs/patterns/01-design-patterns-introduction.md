# Design Patterns

- Why do we need patterns? The blunt answer is we don't want to
reinvent the wheel!

# Types of design patterns

Design patterns for object orientated programs are divided into three
broad categories listed below.

1. Creational
2. Structural
3. Behavioural

## 1.Creational Pattern

- Creational design patterns relate to how objects are constructed from
classes
- The creational design pattern come with powerful suggestions on how
best to encapsulate the object creation process in a program.
  1. [Builder Pattern](./creational/builder-pattern.md)
  2. [Prototype pattern](./creational/prototype-pattern.md)
  3. Singleton Pattern
  4. [Factory pattern](./creational/factory-pattern.md)
  5. [Abstract factory pattern](./creational/abstract-factory-pattern.md)

## 2. Structural Pattern

- Structural patterns are concerned with the composition of classes i.e. how
the classes are made up or constructed. These include:
  1. [Adapter pattern](./structural/adapter-pattern.md)
  2. Bridge Pattern
  3. [Composite pattern](./structural/composite-pattern.md)
  4. [Decorator Pattern](structural/decorator-pattern.md)
  5. Facade Pattern
  6. Flyweight Pattern
  7. [Proxy pattern](./structural/proxy-pattern.md)

## 3. Behavioral pattern

- Behavioral design patterns dictate the interaction of classes and objects
among each other and the delegation of responsibility. These include:
  1. Interpreter Pattern
  2. Template Pattern
  3. [Chain of responsibilities pattern](./behavioral/chain-of-responsibility-pattern.md)
  4. [Separator Pattern or Command pattern](./behavioral/command-pattern.md)
  5. Iterator Pattern
  6. [Mediator Pattern](behavioral/mediator-pattern.md)
  7. [Memento pattern](./behavioral/memento-pattern.md)
  8. [Observer Pattern](./behavioral/observer-pattern.md)
  9. [State Pattern](behavioral/state-pattern.md)
  10. [Strategy Pattern](behavioral/strategy-pattern.md)
  11. Visitor Pattern
