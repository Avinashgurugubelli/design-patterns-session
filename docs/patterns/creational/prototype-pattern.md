# Prototype pattern

- Prototype Pattern says that cloning of an existing object instead of creating new one and can also be customized as per the requirement.

- This pattern should be followed, if the cost of creating a new object is expensive and resource intensive.

- When we're trying to clone, we should decide between making a shallow or a deep copy. Eventually, it boils down to the requirements.

- For example, if the class contains only primitive and immutable fields, we may use a shallow copy.

- If it contains references to mutable fields, we should go for a deep copy. We might do that with copy constructors or serialization and deserialization.


## Example

- In some games, we want trees or buildings in the background. We may realize that we don't have to create new trees or buildings and render them on the screen every time the character moves.

- So, we create an instance of the tree first. Then we can create as many trees as we want from this instance (prototype) and update their positions. We may also choose to change the color of the trees for a new level in the game.

- The Prototype pattern is quite similar. Instead of creating new objects, we just have to clone the prototypical instance.

    public Tree(double mass, double height) {

        this.height = height;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Tree [mass=" + mass + ", height=" + height + ", position=" + position + "]";
    }

## UML Diagram

![Prototype-Pattern](../resources/Prototype-Pattern.webp)

- In the diagram, we see that the client is telling the prototype to clone itself and create an object. Prototype is an interface and declares a method for cloning itself. ConcretePrototype1 and ConcretePrototype2 implement the operation to clone themselves.
